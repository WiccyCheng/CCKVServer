# Benchmark
### Pubsub
started the server and 100 subscribers and benchmarked the publishing operation. The results are as follows:
```plaintext
publishing              time:   [76.341 Âµs 76.824 Âµs 77.390 Âµs]
                        change: [-0.6231% +0.9935% +2.7754%] (p = 0.29 > 0.05)
```
The average time for a single publish operation is 76.341 microseconds. which is approximately 13,097 publish operations per second.
